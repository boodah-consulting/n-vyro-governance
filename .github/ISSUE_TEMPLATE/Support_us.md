Help support n-vyro.io!

n-vyro.io has always been a community project, not really backed or owned by
any single (or group) of companies. While only baphled is working on it full
time and there certainly isn't a huge company or team anywhere doing all this
work.

As a group of volunteers you can help us in a few ways

- Giving developer time on the project. (Message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/baphled) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/uAYq3xAnx8) for guidance). Companies should be paying their employees to contribute back to the open source projects they use everyday.
- Giving funds by becoming one of our sponsors/donators!
