# Contributing

## Overview

We welcome contributors of all kinds, whether it is making changes to documentation or adding new features. There are a few steps to take into consideration, but for the most part, the process is not that much different from contributing to any other codebase.

Ways of contributing:

 * Product Testing
 * Product Improvements
 * Documentation Improvements
 * Bug Reporting
 * Funding

If you spot something you think we could do with some help with your input is more than welcome.

We want to include as many people in this journey as possible. Paving the way for not only a better way of producing products but also partaking in work and interacting with businesses.

* [Production](#Product)
* [Resources](#Resources)

## Product

We are still in the early phases of development, although in the two years its taken, we are now looking to move the development of this ecosystem into the next phase of the plan.

We now have enough devices to send out to testers. Once these are sent to testers we will take any input received and feed that back into our MVP backlog.

Regardless of whether you are a techie or a professional gardener, we encourage you to contribute.

In addition we are looking for smart, pragmatic, and passionate people who would love to spend some time collaborating with us, and our goal of releasing something cool into the world.
