This serves as a collection of lists which will eventually transition to the documentation that all engineering types
will be able to refer back to when ever they need to verify and get started with working within the n-vyro.io
codebase.

This includes everything from tools of choice, and why we've chosen them, to how we create new PRs and what the
contribution process should look like.
