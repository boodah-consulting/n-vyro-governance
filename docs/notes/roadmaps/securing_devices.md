# Security

We need to be in a good place to be able to release our devices to the public without compromising their security.
This means that we'll need to make sure that all of our devices are communication over SSL, and ideally that our
devices firmware is also encryted. This will put us in a really good position to focus on cleaning up any major UX
issues we may have come back our initial testing phase, and give us enough space for our commericial release.
