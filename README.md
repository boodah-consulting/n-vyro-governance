## Aim

Assisting in improving, and standardising, the current way we automate and track the progress of our beloved plants.

With [n-vyro.io](https://n-vyro.io), you can create your ideal environmental settings without worrying about how everything talks to each other; or whether your devices are giving your data away.

We also make it easier to integrate existing tools into your environment, providing the enhanced functionality you have been missing.

### What We Are Not

 * An Island
 * Profit-driven
 * Concerned with titles
 * Looking for Investors

### What We Are

 * Data-Driven
 * Pragmatic
 * Community Lead
 * Collaborative
 * Innovative
 * Transparent
 * Looking for active members

## Values

 **Community Centric**: We are small at the moment, but we aim to grow into a stable, well-established group that is an extension of its community.

 **Tech for Good**: Not all solutions require technology. We recognise this and aim to use technology as a utility or assistant, not a panacea.

 **Work Smart**: We have spent most of our lives working with ineffective systems. We aim to solve problems our community have, not create new ones.

 **Self Sustainability**: From helping others grow locally to creating social/business systems that provide more social impact than profit. We believe that these do not need to take more than they give.

 **Equity**: We aim to not only help others utilise their skills but also strive to make our products available to as many people as possible, regardless of their privilege or lack thereof.

 **Collaboration**: This is needed when it comes to building something bigger than ourselves. Our workers and community are our core and work closely with us to achieve their goals.

 **Transparency**: As with all companies, we believe that we have something that can help others; and the world. Unlike other companies, we strive to keep our practices in the open as much as pragmatically possible.

 **Modularity**: Whenever things need to either be logically broken up or whether they are becoming too big. We are in favour of using this to help simplify our practices, processes and thinking.

## Mission

### Guidelines

 * [Guidelines](./docs/community/guidelines.md)

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all kinds, whether it is making documentation changes or adding new features.

There are a few steps to take into consideration, but for the most part, the process is not that much different from contributing to any other codebase.

Ways of contributing:

 * Product Testing
 * Product Improvements
 * Documentation Improvements
 * Bug Reporting
 * Funding

If you spot something you think we could do with some help with your input is more than welcome.

We want to include as many people in this journey as possible, paving the way for a better way of producing products, partaking in work and interacting with businesses.

### Product Testing

We have a limited number of spaces available for testing!

Initially, users will need to have the following pre-requisites:

  * Provide critical feedback relating to n-vyro.io
  * Be a member of our Discord
  * Needs to be technically competent
    * Able to install packages
    * Basic knowledge of Linux
    * Able to debug issues and articulate potential issues

### Product Development

We are still in the early phases of growth. Although in the two years it has taken to get here, we are now looking to move to the next stage of the plan.

We now have enough devices to send out to a few testers.

Once these have gone to the testers, we will take any input received and feed that back into our MVP backlog.

Regardless of whether you are a techie or a professional gardener, we encourage you to contribute.

In addition, we are looking for insightful, pragmatic, and passionate people who would love to spend some time collaborating with us and our goal of releasing something cool into the world to becoming founding members.

#### Community Leaders

These kinds of people will need to be able to flutter between groups and mediate or be able to be in a place to be able to make judgement calls when the time deems it, whether within [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpgbAWCvCk) or meetings.

It will be vital to have a number of these kinds of people to help keep the natural diversity at an equilibrium.

#### General Business

We are good at many things Marketing is not one of them.

We would love for someone to help guide us through the exciting times of preparing for funding and take the first steps towards creating a Collaborative enterprise.

#### Product Development

You will be able to fit into the existing group and help guide the delivery of the products for manufacturing.

#### Software Development

We have a relatively stable foundation to work from, but it is by no means perfect. We would love to make n-vyro.io the ecosystem that we all can come to cherish.

For this, there is a lot of work that needs to go into the coming stages.

Ideally, we're open to anyone who has production-level experience with the following languages:

 * Ruby
 * C/C++
 * Golang
 * ES2016+
 * VueJS
 * Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32

They will need to be comfortable with the TDD/BDD approaches of development. A pragmatist who has an affinity for challenging ideas and testing them out. With a strong background in writing well-documented code.

#### Other Important Skills

  * Workers Co-Op
  * Market analysis
  * Strategy
  * Funding/Investment
  * Community Liaison
  * Team Building
  * Administration
  * Facilitators
  * Moderators
  * Strategy

#### Product Testing

The idea is that anyone can test our devices.

And over the coming stages, we will gradually phase our ecosystem into the public domain.

For now, we are opening up the system to a select few testers.

### Bug Reporting

We use GitHub Issues for all of our issues, which helps us keep transparent and provides a mechanism for resolving any unknown bugs.

It is vital to distinguish between a bug and not understanding something relating to the system.

We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpgbAWCvCk), which we use to help with any potential setup issues or technical misunderstandings.

Issues should be repeatable and should provide the current versions of the affected devices.

[NOTE]: We should have a more fluid way of processing bugs and escalating them to PRs.

## When are we ready to become a full workers co-op

We will need to make sure we have implemented these steps before regarding ourselves as a mature organisation.

Steps to a mature organisation:
* shared vision
* accountability
* governance
* shared identity
* a decision-making protocol
* oh yeah, a sustainable business model would be nice
