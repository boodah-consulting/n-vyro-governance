## Aims

Assisting in improving, and standardising, the current way we automate and
track the progress of our beloved plants.

With N-Vyro.io you'll be able to create your ideal environmental settings
without worrying how everything communicates with each other.

We also make it easier to integrate existing equipment into your environment
providing enhanced functionality which has previously been missing.

### What We Are Not

 * Profit driven
 * Concerned with titles
 * Looking for Investors

### What We Are

 * Data Driven
 * Community Lead

## Values

 **Community Centric**: We're a small at the moment but our aim is to grow into a stable, well established group, who
can then fully transition into a workers co-op once we've established all of the processes such a community driven
entity requires.

 **Tech for Good**: We believe that technology can help everyone. So our goal is to provide a system that can be used
 and improved upone regardless of your class and environment.

 **Strive to work efficiently**: We've spent most of our lives working in broken corperate environments. So we've
 learnt how to counter this and we act upon this in all aspects of our business.

 **Self Sustainability**: Consumerism has encouraged people to throw things away for the new. We not only encourage
 you to upgrade and make changes without a free we endeavour to only release new products when it's because the
 community ask for it.

 **Simplicity**: There's many way to automate your grow, and some of these are really cool. But we want people to
 being able to use these kinds of tech without having to be IT geeks.

 **Equity**: We believe that everyone has value and we aim to not only help them actualise this but to also encourage
 other to do the same. We also strive to make our products available to as many people as possible, regardless of
 their privilege, or lack there of.

 **Collaboration**: We firmly believe that for things to improve you have to work together. Not only when it comes to
 internal business but we're proving our community with products that they've asked for and we aim to work closely
 with our community to enrich their lives.

 **Transparency**: As with all companies, we feel that we have somthing that can really help others, and the world.
 but unlike other companies we strive to keep as much of our practices in the open.

 **Composability**: Not only do we value use them an engineer perspective but we also find it vital in how we work and
 organise.

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all kinds, whether it's making documentational changes or adding a new feature. There a are
few steps to take into consideration but for the most part the process isn't that much different from contributing to
any other codebase.

Ways of contributing:

* Product improvements
* Product testing
* Documentation Improvements
* Bug Reporting

It's perfectly okay if you feel you have a range of skills, or that you may not have the skills required to contrbute.
As long as you're passionate, engaged in taking part but being clear when you're unable you're more than welcome to
contribute in the many of forms of contribution we offer.

This is a community sport, we want to include as many people in this journey as possible and path the way for not only
better way for providing products and also partaking in work and interacting with businesses.

### Product Building

We're still in the early phases of development. Although we've achieved alot considering our limit on resources and
other contributors, we're looking to move the development of this ecosystem into the next phases.

We have enough for, a select few, users to test out these devices and give us some initial feedback. This will help us
to make sure we're on the right track before we straight to focus more on the really important aspects of the product.

However, to get there we need help, regardless of whether your're a techie or whether you're a professional gardener
we encourage you to contribute.

We're also looking for people who are passionate about the same kind of things that we are, who would love to spend
some time collaborating with us towards the goal of finally releasing something cool into the world.

#### Collective Orchestrators

These kinds of people will need to be able to flutter between groups and be able to mediation, or be able to be in a
place to be able to make a judgement call, when the time deams it. This could be within Discord or within a collective
meeting.

It will be important have a number of these kinds of people to help keep the nature diversity at an equilibrium.

As these roles are not your typical hat, this will typically be determined by the group, based off of the persons
historic performance and how they feel said person would do within such capacity.

They'll be a requirement to have a number of these types of positions, especially as the group grows as ideally we
would like to be self governing and that typically doesn't happen when a group only has two extremes and nothing of
the inbetween.

#### General Business

We're good at a number of things but Marketing isn't particularly one of them. We'd love for someone to help guide as
through the excite times of preparing to for funding and take the first steps towards creating a truly Collaborative

#### Software Development

We have a relatively stable foundation to work from, but it is by no means perfect. We'd love for other with a passion
for collaboration, programming, growing, and automation, to help us make n-vyro.io the product that we'd all love.

Ideally we're open to anyone who has production level experienced with the following languages:

 * Ruby
 * C/C++
 * Golang
 * ES2016+
 * VueJS
 * Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32

They'll need to be comfortable with the TDD/BDD approaches of development, with a strong background in writing well
documentated code, but also be extremely pragmatic and have a nature desire to want to challenge ideas and not egos.

### Bug Reporting

We use GitHub Issues for all of our issues. This helps us to keep transparency and provides a clear mechanism for
resolving any unknown bugs.

It's important to distinguist between a bug and not understanding something relating to the system. We have a Discord,
which can be used to help with any potential teething problems.

Issues should be repeatable and should provide the current versions of the effected devices.

[NOTE]: We should have a more fluid way of processing bugs and escalating them to PRs.

### Community

 * [Guidelines](./docs/community/guidelines.md)

## When are we ready to become a full workers co-op

We'll need to make sure we've implemented these steps before we can perceive ourselves as a mature organisation

steps to a mature organisation:
* shared vision
* accountability
* governance
* shared identity
* a decision-making protocol
* oh yeah, a sustainable business model would be nice
