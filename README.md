## Aim

Assisting in improving, and standardising, the current way we automate and track the progress of our beloved plants.

With [n-vyro.io](https://n-vyro.io), you can create your ideal environmental settings without worrying about how everything talks to each other; or whether your devices are giving your data away.

We make it easier to integrate existing tech into your environment, enhancing it; providing valuable data you never knew you had.

### What We Are Not

 * An Island
 * Profit-driven
 * Concerned with titles
 * Looking for Investors

### What We Are

 * Data-Driven
 * Pragmatic
 * Community Lead
 * Collaborative
 * Innovative
 * Transparent
 * Looking for active members

## Values

 **Community Centric**: We are small, but we aim to grow into a stable, well-established group intertwined with the community.

 **Tech for Good**: Not all solutions require technology. We recognise this and aim to use technology as a utility or assistant, not a panacea.

 **Work Smart**: We have spent most of our lives working with ineffective systems. We aim to solve problems our community have, not create new ones.

 **Self Sustainability**: Helping others grow locally, to creating social/business systems that provide more social impact than profit. We believe that these do not need to take more than they give.

 **Equity**: We aim to not only help others utilise their skills but also strive to make our products available to as many people as possible, regardless of their privilege or lack thereof.

 **Collaboration**: This is needed when it comes to building something bigger than ourselves. Our workers and community are our core and work closely with us to achieve their goals.

 **Transparency**: As with all companies, we believe that we have something that can help others; and the world. Unlike other companies, we strive to keep our practices in the open as much as pragmatically possible.

 **Modularity**: Whenever things need to either be logically broken up or whether they are becoming too big. We are in favour of using this to help simplify our practices, processes and thinking.

## Mission

## Products

## Community

A community is not just some organic thing that comes about. It needs nurturing, a shared vision and a shared goal. And it is with this spirit that we take community extremely seriously. For us to grow as a co-op, there needs to be cohesion, and this is not something that just happens by changes.

With this being said, we think it is super important to cultivate a community, much like how one would tend a garden or their education.

We will slowly build up the foundations, testing our boundaries and expanding and compress as the situation demands it.

As this is a formative stage, we will be taking our time to build a solid footing when we expand; we do so with collective focus and determination.

Our goal here is to make something that can stand on its own, with a nudge from time to time, not something driven by faceless outsiders or internal personalities.

For that reason that we feel forming a solid collective infrastructure, helping to strengthen these values. So that, once the entity is expanding it can naturally adapt.

### Where are we?

Mostly we can be found on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpgbAWCvCk), although we are also here:

 * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NVyroIO)
 * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NVyroIO)

### How to take part?

Check out [contributing](#contributing) section.

### Guidelines

 * [Guidelines](./docs/community/guidelines.md)

And over the coming stages, we will gradually phase our ecosystem into the public domain.

For now, we are opening up the system to a select few testers.

* [Introduction n-vyro.io](./docs/contributing/introduction.md)

### Bug Reporting

We use GitHub Issues for all of our issues, which helps us keep transparent and provides a mechanism for resolving any unknown bugs.

It is vital to distinguish between a bug and not understanding something relating to the system.

We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/EpgbAWCvCk), which we use to help with any potential setup issues or technical misunderstandings.

Issues should be repeatable and should provide the current versions of the affected devices.

[NOTE]: We should have a more fluid way of processing bugs and escalating them to PRs.

## When are we ready to become a full workers co-op

We will need to make sure we have implemented these steps before regarding ourselves as a mature organisation.

Steps to a mature organisation:
* shared vision
* accountability
* governance
* shared identity
* a decision-making protocol
* oh yeah, a sustainable business model would be nice
