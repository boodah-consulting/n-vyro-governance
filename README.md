## Aims

track the progress of our beloved plants.

without worrying how everything communicates with each other.

We also make it easier to integrate existing equipment into your environment
providing enhanced functionality which has previously been missing.

## Values

 **Community Centric**: We're a small at the moment but our aim is to grow into a stable, well established group, who
can then fully transition into a workers co-op once we've established all of the processes such a community driven
entity requires.

 **Tech for Good**: We believe that technology can help everyone. So our goal is to provide a system that can be used
 and improved upone regardless of your class and environment.

 **Strive to work efficiently**: We've spent most of our lives working in broken corperate environments. So we've
 learnt how to counter this and we act upon this in all aspects of our business.

 **Self Sustainability**: Consumerism has encouraged people to throw things away for the new. We not only encourage
 you to upgrade and make changes without a free we endeavour to only release new products when it's because the
 community ask for it.

 **Simplicity**: There's many way to automate your grow, and some of these are really cool. But we want people to
 being able to use these kinds of tech without having to be IT geeks.

 **Equity**: We believe that everyone has value and we aim to not only help them actualise this but to also encourage
 other to do the same. We also strive to make our products available to as many people as possible, regardless of
 their privilege, or lack there of.

 **Collaboration**: We firmly believe that for things to improve you have to work together. Not only when it comes to
 internal business but we're proving our community with products that they've asked for and we aim to work closely
 with our community to enrich their lives.

 **Transparency**: As with all companies, we feel that we have somthing that can really help others, and the world.
 but unlike other companies we strive to keep as much of our practices in the open.

 **Composability**: Not only do we value use them an engineer perspective but we also find it vital in how we work and
 organise.

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all kinds, whether it's making documentational changes or adding a new feature. There a are
few steps to take into consideration but for the most part the process isn't that much different from contributing to
any other codebase.

Ways of contributing:

* Product improvements
* Product testing
* Documentation Improvements
* Bug Reporting

### Product improvements

#### Marketing

#### Product

#### Development

We have a relatively stable foundation to work from, but it is by no means perfect. We'd love for other with a passion
for collaboration, programming, growing, and automation, to help us make n-vyro.io the product that we'd all love.

Ideally we're open to anyone who has production level experienced with the following languages:

 * Ruby
 * C/C++
 * Golang
 * ES2016+
 * VueJS
 * Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32

They'll need to be comfortable with the TDD/BDD approaches of development, with a strong background in writing well
documentated code, but also be extremely pragmatic and have a nature desire to want to challenge ideas and not egos.

## When are we ready to become a full workers co-op

We'll need to make sure we've implemented these steps before we can perceive ourselves as a mature organisation

steps to a mature organisation:
* shared vision
* accountability
* governance
* shared identity
* a decision-making protocol
* oh yeah, a sustainable business model would be nice
