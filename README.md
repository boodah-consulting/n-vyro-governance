## Aims

Assisting in improving, and standardising, the current way we automate and track the progress of our beloved plants.

With N-Vyro.io you can create your ideal environment settings without worrying about how everything communicates with each other.

We also make it easier to integrate existing equipment into your environment, providing enhanced functionality previously missing.

### What We Are Not

 * An Island
 * Profit-driven
 * Concerned with titles
 * Looking for Investors

### What We Are

 * Data-Driven
 * Pragmatic
 * Community Lead
 * Collaborative
 * Innovative
 * Transparent
 * Looking for active members

## Values

 **Community Centric**: We are small at the moment, but we aim to grow into a stable, well-established group that is an extension of its community.

 **Tech for Good**: Not all problems can be solved with technology. We recognise this and aim to use technology as a utility or assistant, not a panacea for all solutions.

 **Work Smart**: We have spent most of our lives working with ineffective systems. We aim to solve problems our community have, not create new ones.

 **Self Sustainability**: From helping others grow locally to creating social/business systems that provide more social impact than profit. We believe that these do not need to take more than they give.

 **Equity**: We believe that everyone has value. With this vision, we aim to not only help others utilise their skills, but we also strive to make our products available to as many people as possible, regardless of their privilege or lack thereof.

 **Collaboration**: We firmly believe in order for things to improve that we have to work together. This is needed when it comes to internal business and the community. Having the community steering change and working closely with us to achieve their goals.

 **Transparency**: As with all companies, we believe that we have something that can help others and the world. But unlike other companies, we strive to keep as much of our practices in the open as much as possible.

 **Modularity**: Not only do we value using them from an engineering perspective, but we also find it vital in how we work and organise as a collective.

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all kinds, whether it is making documentation changes or adding new features. There are a few steps to take into consideration, but for the most part, the process is not that much different from contributing to any other codebase.

Ways of contributing:

 * Product Testing
 * Product Improvements
 * Documentation Improvements
 * Bug Reporting
 * Funding

If you spot something you think we could do with some help with your input is more than welcome.

We want to include as many people in this journey as possible. Paving the way for not only a better way of producing products but also partaking in work and interacting with businesses.

### Product Building

We are still in the early phases of development, although in the two years its taken, we are now looking to move the development of this ecosystem into the next phase of the plan.

We now have enough devices to send out to testers. Once these are sent to testers we will take any input received and feed that back into our MVP backlog.

Regardless of whether you are a techie or a professional gardener, we encourage you to contribute.

In addition we are looking for smart, pragmatic, and passionate people who would love to spend some time collaborating with us, and our goal of releasing something cool into the world.

#### Community Leaders

These kinds of people will need to be able to flutter between groups, and mediate or be able to be in a place to be able to make judgement calls when the time deems it. This could be within Discord or meetings.

It will be vital, to have a number of these kinds of people, to help keep the natural diversity at an equilibrium.

#### General Business

We are good at many things, Marketing is not one of them.

 * Ruby
 * C/C++
 * Golang
 * ES2016+
 * VueJS

They will need to be comfortable with the TDD/BDD approaches of development. A pragmatist who has an affinity for challenging ideas and testing them out. With a strong background in writing well-documented code.

### Bug Reporting

We use GitHub Issues for all of our issues. This helps us to keep transparent and provides a mechanism for resolving any unknown bugs.

It is vital to distinguish between a bug and not understanding something relating to the system.

We have a Discord, which can be used to help with any potential teething problems.

Issues should be repeatable and should provide the current versions of the affected devices.

[NOTE]: We should have a more fluid way of processing bugs and escalating them to PRs.

### Community

 * [Guidelines](./docs/community/guidelines.md)

## When are we ready to become a full workers co-op

We will need to make sure we have implemented these steps before regarding ourselves as a mature organisation.

Steps to a mature organisation:
* shared vision
* accountability
* governance
* shared identity
* a decision-making protocol
* oh yeah, a sustainable business model would be nice
