# Governance

## Basics

Yomi Colledge (@baphled), the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL), holds ultimate decision-making power while seeking to represent a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole.

## Participants

Membership is open to anyone who wants to join.

The BDFL can remove misbehaving members at will for the sake of the common good.

In the event that the BDFL is unable or unwilling to continue leadership, the BDFL may appoint a new BDFL or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The BDFL sets the community's policies and makes decisions for the community, taking reasonable account of input from other community members.

The BDFL is responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If members are not happy with the BDFL's leadership, they are free to voice their concerns or leave the community.

## Process

Community members are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

The BDFL can change the governance structure of the community at will.
